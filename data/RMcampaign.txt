			`You can't help but overhear a group of people arguing loudly between two parked freighters.`

			`	As you approach you see that most of them are techs crawling all over the ships.`
			`	"Intolerable." A clipped voice cuts through the chatter, "I don't care how it gets down, but we will honor the contract."`
			`	"Ma'am." A young well-dressed man says, "Our fleet is already stretched to the limits. Everyone is out with deleveries, there is no way we can move this cargo."`
			`	A tall stately woman, in a long black coat with short stylishly cut black hair, rips a tablet from the young man's hands, and hisses "There is always a way."`
			`	She flicks her wrist scrolling through it, and then her eyes suddenly look up and straight at you, "Captain <last>." She says and then quickly looks back down at the tablet, "Of the... <ship>. You've done acceptable work for us before. Would you be interested in a rush job, right now?"`

			`	The woman's face radiates disgust, "How unremarkable." Her attention drops from you completely, and she begins giving clipped orders to her underlings.`
			`	You continue on into the spaceport.`

			`	"Wonderful." She says without much emotion, and then points to one of the crews unsucessfully working on the downed freighters, "Forget about those; transfer their cargos to the <ship>."`
			`	The crews immediately stop what they are doing and throw themselves into their new task. Machinery suddenly appears and the freighter's holds are emptied at an alarming speed.`
			`	"The cargo needs to be on <destination> in four days. There may be more work here on <source> for you when you're done." Her face hints at a frown, "Our associate fleet is struggling with the demand of a new contract."`
			`	Her eyes flick to her well-dressed assistant, "You're fired." She then turns and heads to the nearby multistoried building, a trail of sychophants in her wake.`
