When making changes, do so on your own branch and submit the changes as a pull request. Do not force push to main.
When creating a pull request, use a branch name starting with your username (`<username>-<topic>`). Do not merge your own pull request yourself (unless it's a fix caught by the checkers). Let another collaborator review and merge.
Exception: if your pull request has two approving reviews then you can merge it.
If somebody is assigned to a pull request, do not merge it unless they have submitted an approving review.
Other than that, be free with the merge button on pull requests that are not yours.
Use "Squash and Merge" when merging a pull request, as opposed to a regular merge. After merging a pull request, delete the HEAD branch.
