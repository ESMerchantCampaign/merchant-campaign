            `   As you approach you see that most of them are techs crawling all over the ships.`
            `   "Intolerable." A clipped voice cuts through the chatter, "I don't care how it gets down, but we will honor the contract."`
            `   "Ma'am." A young well-dressed man says, "Our fleet is already stretched to the limits. Everyone is out with deleveries, there is no way we can move this cargo."`
            `   A tall stately woman, in a long black coat with short stylishly cut black hair, rips a tablet from the young man's hands, and hisses "There is always a way."`
            `   She flicks her wrist scrolling through it, and then her eyes suddenly look up and straight at you, "Captain <last>." She says and then quickly looks back down at the tablet, "Oh the... <ship>. You've done work with us before. Would you be interested in a rush job, right now?"`
            choice
                `   "Always.`
                `   "Of course."`

            `   The woman's face radiates disgust, "How unremarkable." Her attention drops from you completely, and she begins giving clipped orders to her underlings.`
            `   You continue on into the spaceport.`
