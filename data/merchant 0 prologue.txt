			`You walk into the busy spaceport bar of <origin> as instructed by the man who met you when you landed. One of the more wealthy customers catches your eye and beckons you over to his table. As you walk in that direction, you notice a blue pin on his vest with the label "Jacob Schmidt, CTO"` # CTO stands for "Chief Trading Officer"

			`	"Ah. I see my information is incorrect. In that case, I am afraid that I cannot recruit you. Goodbye." The tall man takes a note, stands, and leaves; you notice the short bartender looking at you with a strange expression and a slight tinge of hostility.`
			choice
				`	"Why are you looking at me like that?"`
				`	(Attempt to exit.)`
			`	The plump barkeep heads in your direction and stands in between you and the door. "Do you know what you have done?" Without waiting for an answer, he continues. "That guy is one of the most important people on this planet. Why would you turn away from a job offer with such affluence involved? I hear that Republic Mercantile is an influence galaxy-wide." With that, the proprietor goes back to his desk, leaving you perplexed.`

I need to consult with the leaders on <planet>; the officials of my organization would not like to see our monopoly disappear." He winks. "At any rate, your first mission is transporting me. Let's get going."`

			`A Syndicate guard greets you and your passenger as <ship> lands. "Good morning, Mr. Schmidt. Your ride is just this way." "One moment," Jacob says, and turns to you. "Would you like to come with me for some bureaucratic paperwork? I assure you that most spaceship captains do not find this interesting, but if you end up joining us it might be worth it."`
			choice
				`	"I'm up for anything."`
				`	"Nah. Count me out."`
					goto shipwait
			`	The Syndicate guards lead the Republic Mercantile's delegation toward a sleek limosine the same color as Markab's star. "This should suit you nicely, Mr. Schmidt. It is only a short drive to the office." After a few minutes of speeding through the wide streets of <origin>, passing buildings under construction on the way, the red vehicle screeches to a halt in front of an imposing grey building.`
			`	The guard leads you up the wide steps to a large metal door, taps in a security code, and opens it. "Welcome to Syndicated Trade's headquarters, Mr. Schmidt and Captain <last>. Here we collaborate with merchants from the entirety of human space and command the great trade routes of our corporation. Please take the second elevator from the left up to floor thirty-three; the office you are looking for is number thirty-three hundred and four. Good day."`
			`	Following the guard's instructions brings you to a palatial office that must be at least a hundred meters in every direction. At the far end a tall man sits at a large desk; the only other visible item in the room is a huge grandfather clock. There are no windows.`
			choice
				`	"What is this place?"`
				`	(Remain silent.)`
			`	"Welcome, welcome! Allow me to introduce myself. I am James Aden, HCTO of the Syndicate. Would you remind you of your names? I meet too many people each day..." "<first> <last>," you say, and Jacob introduces himself as well, continuing with "We have come to request that you desist from your commandeering of our Mercantile's trade routes." He pauses. "How about a deal. You control all routes in the Deep and here, but we will take priority in all systems of the august Republic."`
			`	The HCTO blinks. "But my dear Jacob," he says ingratiatingly, "We have done nothing of the kind. Not a single ship of our fleet has interfered in any way with your company, unless you were masquerading as pirates. That's not so likely, is it? And besides, what would we gain? Enmity? No." "Well, than, what-" Jacob sputters before being interrupted. "Do know, however, that a startup your mercantile is unlikely to have heard of is begun, named Alphabet Transport Solutions (or ATS), headquartered on <destination>. That is where you are most likely to find answers."`
			choice
				`	"And how do you know of this?"`
				`	"Sounds very likely to be true."`
			`	"They had a big publicity campaign hereabouts, though we soon told them their efforts were unappreciated. At any rate, a meeting with a very important person is scheduled in two minutes. I would thank you if you could leave." Jacob glares at the man, but exits the room, pulling you after him. "Let us go to <planet>, <first>. I have a feeling that Mr. Aden was telling nothing but lies; however, it can not hurt to find out. Please take us fast while look them up. If they do exist, I will schedule a meeting on <date>."`
				accept
			label shipwait
			`	After about an hour, Jacob Schmidt returns with a strange expression on his face. "They say they haven't been doing anything, but recommended a different startup called ATS, or Alphabet Transport Solutions, on <destination>. Why don't you take me there; I scheduled a meeting on <date>."`

			`	A stocky woman steps out of the crowd. "Well, what are you doing here? <origin> isn't controlled by your silly mercantile, and not by the Syndicate either. You are trespassing on land not your own; I assume you know that?" Jacob evenly replies, "Who gave your company this planet? It is not yours."`
			`	The woman's demeanor changes; she seems almost friendly now. "Well, why don't you come into the famous Daniella's office? There is a rainstorm scheduled in a few minutes." "Thank you, but no. Captain <first> and I have other business." Aside to you, he says, "I do not trust this Daniella Dalga. It is a widely-known fact that she used to be a pirate before some startup mysteriously hired her. That company is probably Alphabet Transport Solutions. Let's go back to <planet> so I can talk this over with other executives."`

			`Taking a seat in the main bar, you gaze out at the long line of parked cargo haulers on <origin>'s landing pads. It's a peaceful scene and very quiet; the only noises are the creak of turning cranes and the occasional crash as an empty cargo crate falls to the ground. Suddenly, this scene of tranquility is broken. A Shuttle comes careening in and brakes barely in time to avoid hitting the bar. Out of it steps a breathless courier, who rushes in and shouts, "Mars is experiencing a severe food shortage! If you don't hurry and help, millions will starve!"`
			`	Just then Jacob appears, apprently having heard the news from someone else. He immediately takes charge. Jumping onto a table, he shouts, "All captains, please cancel any prior occupations and help. We need to help, for our honor and the sake of the population of <planet>, which, as you know, is in the <system> system. We leave in five hours EST."` # Earth Standard Time

			`	At this, he perks up and takes a seat. "Luckily, they do not think violence is warranted... yet. They are going to try diplomacy a while longer; I told them we didn't exactly make the best showing. Next time will be much more official and we will have a fleet, not one ship, powerful as <ship> may be. At any rate, you have been assigned <tons> of cargo. We must get to <planet> before <date> if we want to save the inhabitants." He gets up and heads toward another captain, presumably to give them their assignment.`
