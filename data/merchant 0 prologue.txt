			`	As you approach the pair, one of them stops mid-sentence. "Why, that looks like Captain <last>! Captain, you're exactly who we're looking for."`

			`	"As a matter of fact, we do," replies the first captain, a wicked grin splitting his face. "Captain Haight and I are the unlucky souls in charge of getting a shipment of mining equipment to <planet> by <deadline>. Problem is, Captain Haight here is getting cold feet over some reports of pirates in that region, and refuses to go without a 'reputable escort.' Well, I know you've done some bounty hunting for the Republic Mercantile, so I figure you're qualified. What do you say?"`

			`	The smile on the captain's face widens, threatening to crack it in half. "Glad to hear it! Glen Rodgers shall be forever indebted to you... quite literally, of course, with the prices as they are right now." He snaps a jaunty two-fingered salute and trots over to his ship to direct the dockworkers loading his cargo.`
			`	Captain Haight rolls her eyes and thanks you. "Thanks for your help, captain. Just get us to <destination> by <date>, and <payment> will be yours - provided you last that long on the same coms channel as that buffoon." With that dry comment, she turns back to her ship, leaving you to return to yours.`

				`	"That's me."`
					goto me
				`	"Sorry, you must be looking for someone else."`

			`	The captain appears flabbergasted. He opens his mouth, but no words come out. As you walk away, he appears to be doing a very good impression of a beached fish.`
				decline

			label pay
			`	Somehow, the captain's smile gets even larger as he talks, reminding you of a very agitated shark. "Money makes the world go 'round, doesn't it... funny, that. Every world I've ever been on was round, even if they were dirt poor. You know - "`
			`	"Shut up, Glen," Haight interjects. Turning to you she adds, "<payment> should cover it. How does that sound?"`

			`	"Based on how that went," Captain Haight comments dryly, "we're going to need an escort going back the other way, too. Meet us in the spaceport in an hour if you're interested. Who knows, Glen might even have recovered enough to apologize for his patronizing comments and bad jokes by then."`

			`When you walk into the spaceport bar, it takes you a moment to find Captain Rodgers. Finally, you see him hunched over the bar nursing a flat and seemingly undisturbed drink. Just as you're considering the best course of action, Captain Haight taps you on the shoulder.`

In case it wasn't clear, we'd like your help as an escort on our return trip to New China, with a detour en-route to <destination> to drop off some supplies for the nuclear power plant there. This time around, I think I can convince Glen to chip in so we can offer you <payment>. How does that sound?"`

				`	"Sounds good to me."`
				`	"Sorry, but I have other jobs I need to do instead."`
					goto others

			`	"Great! If it's all right with you, we'll take off just as soon as I can rouse Glen out of his stupor - I don't want the Winded Dragon's hull getting blasted by this atmosphere any more than necessary."`

			`You exit hyperspace into a seemingly ordinary star system. A lone Free Worlds ship, patrolling well outside the Free Worlds' borders, turns to face your convoy as you flash towards <planet>.`
			`	Haight's voice comes over your com network. "Captain <last>, I have a bad feeling about this."`
			`	"A bad feeling? You never have bad feelings... except for the other 386 times in the last month," Rodgers responds. "Face it, you're just annoyed because there's no pirates to scare me this time."`
			`	As if on cue, you see a brief flash from the Free Worlds ship. And then another. And then the sky is lighting up with plasma fire.`
			`	"Let's get out of here," Haight says in a flat voice, "unless, of course, you want to say hello to our peaceful little friend, Glen?"`
			`	Glen mumbles something unintelligible.`
			`	"That's what I thought. Now, let's see if we can land on <planet> in one piece."`

			`If Captain Rodgers looked like a beached fish on Hopper, he looks like a drowning Skymoot dragon when you disembark the <ship>: flopping about helplessly, slightly twitchy, and dripping water. He is leaning on one of his crew members, who is holding an empty bucket. The water on his eyebrows is slowly freezing, and he'll probably be suffering from hypothermia in ten minutes unless someone gives him a towel and a warm dry spaceship to sit in.`
			`	While you're watching Captain Rodgers' theatrics, a large hovercraft drives up to the spaceport. Four parka-clad New Greenlanders climb out and help Haight's crew transfer the supplies for the nuclear power plant. Finally, they thank her and drive off.`
			`	Business concluded, Captain Haight walks over to stand beside your ship. "Well, Captain <last>," she asks, "Ready to go on to <destination>? We've got to finish our job and warn the Republic Mercantile about the disguised pirates, after all."`
			choice
				`	"Of course."`
					goto yes
				`	"Actually, I'm going to go my own way. It's too risky flying with Captain Rodgers."`
			`	Haight laughs, and then realizes you weren't joking. "Very well, then. But you've just lost <payment>." She shrugs and returns to the Winded Dragon. In minutes, you are standing by yourself in the freezing cold while the two freighters scream through New Greenland's atmosphere.`

			`	Captain Haight produces a credit chip worth <payment> and drops it into your hand. "Thank you, Captain <last>. Glen proved quite generous. I barely had to take two ounces of flesh." She winks.`
			`	"Anyways, the long and short of it is, we'd like to talk with you about that disguised pirate you ran into in Arcturus. If you're up to it, Captain, we're meeting in the Mercantile's spaceport office in fifteen minutes."`

			`Arriving at the Republic Mercantile spaceport office, you are met by Cook, Haight, and a pair of young starship captains wearing leather jackets with the words "Mercantile Security" emblazoned on them. Cook motions you toward an empty seat.`
			choice
				`	(Sit down.)`
				`	(Remain standing.)`
			`	"Well then," Cook addresses the group, "now that everyone's here we may as well crack on with it. Athena, the floor is yours."`
			`	Captain Haight stands up, brandishing a 5D memory crystal. "Thank you. Now, as you may know, I've just returned from an intelligence-gathering operation in the Dirt Belt. Unfortunately, I can confirm that there are indeed disguised pirates running rampant in the region. Captain <last> and I encountered one such pirate in Arcturus."`
			`	One of the Security captains interrupts. "How do we know the pirate was disguised? What if the Free Worlds really are engaged in piracy?"`
			`	Haight glowers at the captain. "First of all, this ship mounted two Gatling guns. The Free Worlds do not have any Gatling guns in their arsenal that we are aware of. On top of that, I was able to intercept some of the Hawk's communications using the Winded Dragon's spy suite. According to the lab, the signals were encoded using the same system that the Parliamentary Guard was using to discuss VIP moves during the bombings of Geminus and Martini - a system that costs approximately two million credits a minute to operate, and has yet to be seen be used anywhere else. There is no sign that the Free Worlds even has such encryption technology, and they certainly wouldn't use it to communicate with a lone interceptor in the middle of nowhere. No, this is definitely one of the ships we've been looking for."`
			choice
				`	"One of? There's more of those ships?"`
				`	"You mean the Winded Dragon wasn't carrying the supplies you said you were carrying?"`
					goto liar
				`	"Where are these pirates coming from?"`
					goto where
			`	"Yes, there's more of those ships," Haight acknowledges. "We've had eight sightings now, including our encounter, and we figure there must be at least three such ships. All interceptors armed with Gatling guns and painted green, none of which acted like the Free Worlds. We don't know where they're coming from, but it sure doesn't seem to be the Free Worlds. We've had reports of their activity as far north as Delta Velorum."`
				goto "dirt belt"
		
			label liar
			`	"No," Haight responds brusquely. "We did mislead you, and the Winded Dragon is more of a sophisticated scanner platform than a long-haul freighter. But it's still a freighter, and we really were carrying mining equipment and nuclear fuel."`
			`	The Security captain speaks up again. "How many of these ships did you say there were again?"`
			`	Haight's response is immediate. "We've had eight sightings now, including this last encounter, and we figure there must be at least three such ships. All interceptors armed with Gatling guns and painted green, none of which acted like the Free Worlds. We don't know where they're coming from, but it sure doesn't seem to be the Free Worlds. We've had reports of their activity as far north as Delta Velorum."`
				goto "dirt belt"

			label where
			`	"Honestly, we don't know. We've had eight sightings, mostly spread across the middle of the Dirt Belt, but we have no idea what planet they're using as a base. We even had one sighting near Delta Velorum, and that could be their base for all we know."`

			label "dirt belt"
			`	"But that was an isolated occurence, no?" asks the other Security captain.`
			`	"Yes, it was. Most likely, they're based in Delta Sagittarii or Rastaban or one of the other systems in that region. And that's why you're here."`
			`	"Yes, we want you three captains to lead a patrol of the region," Cook interjects smoothly, ignoring the glower that Haight shoots his direction. "Captain <last>, since you've had some contact with these people before, we'd like you to lead the patrol. Does that work for you?"`
			choice
				`	"Sure."`
					goto casual
				`	"Yes, sir."`
					goto casual
				`	"Why can't the Navy lead the patrol?"`
					goto navy
				`	"Sorry, but I'm needed elsewhere. You'll have to find someone else to lead the patrol."`

			label reject
			`	Cook seems disappointed, but hides it well. "Very well, then. If you ever want to work with the Republic Mercantile again, you know where to find us. Gospeed."`
			`	By the time you leave the room, Haight appears to have talked Cook into letting her lead the patrol.`
				decline
			
			label navy
			`	"To be frank, the Navy has better things to do with its time than fly around empty systems looking for pirates. Not to mention that, if they found such a pirate, a malicious agent could simply record the battle between the Navy ship and the imposter. A video wouldn't hold up as evidence in court, of course, but it could easily sway public opinion in the Free Worlds and bring about a more open war."`
			`	"Needless to say, the Militia isn't going to get involved either, because those systems are technically in Republic space and any action could be considered an act of war. Perhaps if you can nail a few more of the brigands and get some solid proof we'll be able to bring the Navy and Militia in, but not until then."`
			choice
				`	"In that case, I'm honored to lead the patrol."`
				`	"Sorry, but I'm needed elsewhere. You'll have to find someone else to fill the Navy's shoes."`
				goto reject
			
			label casual
			`	"Glad to hear it! I'm sure those two will be ready before you are," he says nodding at the two Security captains who are already halfway out the door, "but don't forget that you're in charge. I want a survey report of <waypoints> on my desk as soon as possible. If you see any pirates lurking in any of the systems, take them out, even if they're not dressed up like the Free Worlds, but don't worry about hunting down any pirates that are just passing through."`
			`	As you turn to leave, Cook taps you on the shoulder. "Oh, and one more thing. Since it looks like we're all going to be working together here, we might as well be on first-name terms. Call me Drake."`
			`	"<first>," you reply.`
			`	Drake tips his hat and ushers you out of the offices and towards your waiting patrol fleet.`

Two of the ships came out of nowhere and decimated one of our convoys, and we're all under a lot of pressure now. Say, would you be willing to meet in the Mercantile spaceport office again in an hour or so, once I've had the chance to look over your report."`
