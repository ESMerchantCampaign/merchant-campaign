When creating a pull request, do not merge it yourself (unless it's a fix caught by the checkers). Let another collaborator review and merge.
If somebody is assigned to a pull request, do not merge it unless they have submitted an approving review.
Other than that, be free with the merge button on pull requests that are not yours.
Use "Squash and Merge" when merging a pull request, as opposed to a regular merge. After merging a pull request, delete the HEAD branch.
