When making changes, do so on your own branch and submit the changes as a pull request. Do not force-push to the `main` branch.<br>
Small updates should have a branch name starting with your username (`<username>-<topic>`). Larger branches which multiple people may push to need not have the username prefix.<br>
If somebody is assigned to a pull request, do not merge it unless they have submitted an approving review.<br>
Use "Squash and Merge" when merging a pull request, as opposed to a regular merge. After merging a pull request, delete the HEAD branch.<br>
If a pull request changes files that somebody else added, request a review from them. GitHub should automatically give you advice on who to request.<br>
