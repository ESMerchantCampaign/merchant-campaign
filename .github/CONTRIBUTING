When creating a pull request, do not merge it yourself (unless it's a fix caught by the checkers). Let another collaborator review and merge.
If somebody is assigned to a pull request, do not merge it unless they have submitted an approving review.
Other than that, be free with the merge button on pull requests that are not yours.
