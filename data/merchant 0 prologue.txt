			`You walk into the busy spaceport bar of <origin> as instructed by the man who met you when you landed. One of the more wealthy customers catches your eye and beckons you over to his table. As you walk in that direction, you notice a blue pin on his vest with the label "Jacob Schmidt, CTO"` # CTO stands for "Chief Trading Officer"

			`	"Ah. I see my information is incorrect. In that case, I am afraid that I cannot recruit you. Goodbye." He takes a note, stands, and leaves; you notice the short bartender looking at you with a strange expression and a slight tinge of hostility.`

				`	"Why are you looking at me like that?"`
				`	(Attempt to exit.)`
			`	The plump barkeep heads in your direction and stands in between you and the door. "Do you know what you have done?" Without waiting for an answer, he continues. "That guy is one of the most important people on this planet. Why would you turn away from a job offer with such affluence involved? I hear that Republic Mercantile is an influence galaxy-wide." With that, the proprietor goes back to his desk, leaving you perplexed.`

			`A Syndicate guard greets you and your passenger as <ship> lands. "Good morning, Mr. Schmidt. Your ride is just this way." "One moment," Jacob says, and turns to you. "Would you like to come with me for some bureaucratic paperwork? I assure you that most spaceship captains do not find this interesting, but if you end up joining us it might be worth it."`

It is only a short drive to the office."
