	"display name" Kunlun
	add attributes "republic mercantile" "republic mercantile headquarters"
	description `In the very early days of hyperspace travel, most settlers chose to put down roots within a few jumps of Earth, because until more fuel depots were built, colonies farther out would seldom be visited by cargo ships. As a result, a lot of effort was put into terraforming and developing worlds that would have been passed over by most colonists today.`
	description `	Kunlun is one such world, and it is now overpopulated, and poor enough that maintaining the terraforming equipment and climate requires almost a third of the planetary government's tax income.`
	description `	Kunlun is also the headquarters of Republic Mercantile, a union of merchants across the known galaxy.`
	add spaceport `	The warehouses for Republic Mercantile take up one large corner, and the traffic of employees is spread throughout the city.`
