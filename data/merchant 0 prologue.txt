			`Walking through the spaceport, you soon come across two Bulk Freighters parked beside each other amidst a frenzy of activity. Cargo is being loaded onto the ships at a frantic pace, but the captains of the two vessels are engaged in a heated debate.`
			choice
				`	(See what they're arguing about.)`
					goto argument
				`	(Walk away.)`
			`	As you turn to walk back to your ship, you are suddenly hailed by one of the two arguing merchant captains. "Captain <last>?! Is that you, captain?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, that's me."`
					goto me
				`	"How do you know my name?"`
					goto name
				`	(Keep walking.)`
			`	You continue walking, and the captain's hails are soon lost amidst the bustle and noise of the spaceport.`
				decline

			label argument
			`	As you approach the pair, one of them stops mid-sentence. "Why, that looks like Captain <last>! Captain, you're exactly who we're looking for."`
			`	The captain, a man you have never seen before in your life, winks at you.`
			choice
				`	"Do you need my help with something?"`
				`	"How do you know my name?"`
					goto name

			`	"As a matter of fact, we do," replies the first captain, a wicked grin splitting his face. "Captain Haight and I are the unlucky souls in charge of getting a shipment of mining equipment to <planet> by <deadline>. Problem is, Captain Haight here is getting cold feet over some reports of pirates in that region, and refuses to go without a 'reputable escort.' Well, I know you've done some bounty hunting for the Republic Mercantile, so I figure you're qualified. What do you say?"`
			choice
				`	"Sure, I'll escort you there."`
					goto willing
				`	"How much will you pay me?"`
					goto pay
				`	"Sorry, but I'm not going that way anytime soon."`

			label me
			`	"Aha! I thought so," the captain says, a wicked grin splitting his face. "I'm Glen Rodgers, by the way, and this is Athena Haight. We're the unlucky souls in charge of getting a shipment of mining equipment to <planet> by <deadline>. Problem is, Captain Haight here is getting cold feet over some reports of pirates in that region, and refuses to go without a 'reputable escort.' Well, I know you've done some bounty hunting for the Republic Mercantile, so I figure you're qualified. What do you say?"`

					goto pay
				`	"Sorry, but I'm not going that way anytime soon."`
					decline

			label willing
			`	The smile on the captain's face widens, threatening to crack it in half. "Glad to hear it! Glen Rodgers shall be forever indebted to you... quite literally, of course, with the prices as they are right now." He snaps a jaunty two-fingered salute and trots over to his ship to direct the dockworkers loading his cargo.`
			`	Captain Haight rolls her eyes and thanks you. "Thanks for your help, captain. Just get us to <destination> by <date>, and <payment> will be yours - provided you last that long on the same coms channel as that buffoon." With that dry comment, she turns back to her ship, leaving you to return to yours.`
				accept

			label name
			`	"Why, a captain as famous as you? How could I not know your name?" he responds. "Actually, I happened to see your name and photo on the Republic Mercantile bounty hunter list just ten minutes ago. You are Captain <last>, no?"`
			choice
				`	"That's me."`
					goto me
				`	"Sorry, you must be looking for someone else."`

			`	The captain appears flabbergasted. He opens his mouth, but no words come out. As you walk away, he appears to be doing a very good impression of a beached fish.`
				decline

			label pay
			`	Somehow, the captain's smile gets even larger as he talks, reminding you of a very agitated shark. "Money makes the world go 'round, doesn't it... funny, that. Every world I've ever been on was round, even if they were dirt poor. You know - "`
			`	"Shut up, Glen," Haight interjects. Turning to you she adds, "<payment> should cover it. How does that sound?"`
			choice
				`	"Sounds good to me."`
					goto willing
				`	"I'm afraid you'll have to find another captain."`
					decline

		conversation
			`Landing on <planet>, Captain Rodgers seems to be in shock, as if the appearance of pirates was a personal betrayal. A very smug Captain Haight hands you a credit chip worth <payment>.`
			`	"Based on how that went," Captain Haight comments dryly, "we're going to need an escort going back the other way, too. Meet us in the spaceport in an hour if you're interested. Who knows, Glen might even have recovered enough to apologize for his patronizing comments and bad jokes by then."`

			`When you walk into the spaceport bar, it takes you a moment to find Captain Rodgers. Finally, you see him hunched over the bar nursing a flat and seemingly undisturbed drink. Just as you're considering the best course of action, Captain Haight taps you on the shoulder.`
			`	"Hello again, Captain <last>. Glad you stopped by. While Glen goes and wallows in self-pity and remorse, why don't you and I discuss business. Want a drink?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, please."`
					goto drink
				`	"No, thanks."`
					goto business
				`	"I can buy my own drinks."`
			`	"Right, and you can join Glen by the bar, too." She rolls her eyes, and orders you a drink anyways. Stuck with a drink and no opportunity to pay for it, you are forced to negotiate with the captain.`
				goto business

			label drink
			`	Captain Haight flags down the bartender and orders some complicated drink that seems to be a local delicacy, thrusting it into you hand as soon as it's ready.`

			`	"Alright, then. In case it wasn't clear, we'd like your help as an escort on our return trip to New China, with a detour en-route to <destination> to drop off some supplies for the nuclear power plant there. This time around, I think I can convince Glen to chip in so we can offer you <payment>. How does that sound?"`
			choice
				`	"Sounds good to me."`
				`	"Sorry, but I have other jobs I need to do instead."`
					goto others

			`	"Great! If it's all right with you, we'll take off just as soon as I can rouse Glen out of his stupor - I don't want the Winded Dragon's hull getting blasted by this atmosphere any more than necessary."`

			`	"All right, I get how it is." Captain Haight stands up. "Thank you for getting us this far, at least."`

			`You exit hyperspace into a seemingly ordinary star system. A lone Free Worlds ship, patrolling well outside the Free Worlds' borders, turns to face your convoy as you flash towards <planet>.`
			`	Haight's voice comes over your com network. "Captain <last>, I have a bad feeling about this."`
			`	"A bad feeling? You never have bad feelings... except for the other 386 times in the last month," Rodgers responds. "Face it, you're just annoyed because there's no pirates to scare me this time."`
			`	As if on cue, you see a brief flash from the Free Worlds ship. And then another. And then the sky is lighting up with plasma fire.`
			`	"Let's get out of here," Haight says in a flat voice, "unless, of course, you want to say hello to our peaceful little friend, Glen?"`
			`	Glen mumbles something unintelligible.`
			`	"That's what I thought. Now, let's see if we can land on <planet> in one piece."`

			`If Captain Rodgers looked like a beached fish on Hopper, he looks like a drowning Skymoot dragon when you disembark the <ship>: flopping about helplessly, slightly twitchy, and dripping water. He is leaning on one of his crew members, who is holding an empty bucket. The water on his eyebrows is slowly freezing, and he'll probably be suffering from hypothermia in ten minutes unless someone gives him a towel and a warm dry spaceship to sit in.`
			`	While you're watching Captain Rodgers' theatrics, a large hovercraft drives up to the spaceport. Four parka-clad New Greenlanders climb out and help Haight's crew transfer the supplies for the nuclear power plant. Finally, they thank her and drive off.`
			`	Business concluded, Captain Haight walks over to stand beside your ship. "Well, Captain <last>," she asks, "Ready to go on to <destination>? We've got to finish our job and warn the Republic Mercantile about the disguised pirates, after all."`
			choice
				`	"Of course."`
					goto yes
				`	"Actually, I'm going to go my own way. It's too risky flying with Captain Rodgers."`
			`	Haight laughs, and then realizes you weren't joking. "Very well, then. But you've just lost <payment>." She shrugs and returns to the Winded Dragon. In minutes, you are standing by yourself in the freezing cold while the two freighters scream through New Greenland's atmosphere.`

			`	Setting down on <planet>, you are met by Captain Haight and a man in a three-piece suit and tie with what looks like a gold pocket watch. "Glad to meet you, Captain <last>," he says, pumping your hand. I'm Drake Cook, Head of Republic Mercantile Security. Captain Haight was just filling me in on the events of your voyage."`
			`	Captain Haight produces a credit chip worth <payment> and drops it into your hand. "Thank you, Captain <last>. Glen proved quite generous. I barely had to take two ounces of flesh." She winks.`
			`	"Anyways, the long and short of it is, we'd like to talk with you about that disguised pirate you ran into in Arcturus. If you're up to it, Captain, we're meeting in the Mercantile's spaceport office in fifteen minutes."`
			`	With that, he lifts his very expensive-looking hat, turns on his heel, and walks away.`
